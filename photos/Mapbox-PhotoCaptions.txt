MapboxSatellite-BrukkarosMountain.jpg: 
This is Brukkaros Mountain, in Namibia, as seen by the USGS’s Landsat 8 satellite. About 80 million years ago, before the extinction of the dinosaurs, Brukkaros exploded much like Mount St Helens did. Only a dry climate like southwest Africa’s could it have survived so long without eroding away. In the late 1920s, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society operated the Brukkaros Solar Observatory on its southern rim—one of the first attempts to precisely measure the sun’s radiation over time. Across the northeast corner of this view you can see the edge of the Kalahari desert’s plateau.
 
MapboxSatellite-ClingmansDome.jpg: 
Fall colors descend on the Great Smoky Mountains from the peaks to the valleys. The winding road leads to Clingmans Dome, the highest point in Tennessee, which is chilly due to its elevation and supports a small but dense evergreen forest. The “smoke” of the Great Smoky Mountains is really a combination of fog and natural chemicals released by the forest. Clingmans Dome is also the highest point of the beautiful Appalachian Trail, which follows the ridge that runs from west to east, then northeast near the road. (Landsat 8 image, October 26th.)

MapboxSatellite-Glaciers.jpg: 
This is the confluence of the Fisher and Mellor glaciers in Antarctica. The region was only mapped in detail in the 1950s, and remains one of the most remote places which scientists still regularly visit. The blue areas are bare ice, where wind has scoured the glacier clean of snow. Researchers sometimes find meteorites lying on the surface in these areas, brought to the surface by the flow of the glaciers.
